    "Welcome to the second tutorial. In the first session, we started with linear regression and built up to logistic regression. We saw that this form of machine learning is really just an optimization problem. We define a test metric to determine how good of a fit we have, and then we use gradient descent to find the minimum of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we were able to build up to program a neural network from scratch! The hardest part of this was the back propagation, getting the gradients further back gets hard to keep track of everything. This is where some of the power of modern tools comes into play. Packages like [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) have an method to keep track of the gradients along the way, even for layers much more complicated that what we have used so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The docker container we are using contains *tensorflow* and [keras](https://keras.io/), which is built on top of tensorflow (or some other systems) and makes building networks very easy. In the rest of this tutorial we will explore how to make simple networks in *Keras*. As this will be easier than before, we will have time to gain an understanding for:\n",

    "Now that we have seen the basics on how to use `Keras` and how to compute metrics on our models, let's move to a physics example. In the `tutorial_2_data` are events generated with Sherpa which are di-gluon and di-quark (parton-level) events from 13 TeV proton-proton collisions. We then analyzed the resulting files by clustering the final-state particles with the anti-kt alogithm. The consituents which have been clustered into the jet with the largest transverse momentum are then put into a comma seperated file. Each row of the file is the hardest jet in each event. The columns are the $p_T$, $\\eta$, and $\\phi$ of up to 10 consituents. Note that we are treating the particles as massless. If there are less than 10 constituents, we fill its place with 0. Finally, the last column is a 0 for the gluons and a 1 for the quarks. Our goal is to make a classifier to distinguish the quarks from the gluons."
